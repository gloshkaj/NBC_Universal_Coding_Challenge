# NBC_Universal_Coding_Challenge
Coding Challenge for NBC <br/>
I have implemented the coding challenge for the Software Engineer, Roku role at NBC using the following dependencies/languages:
```
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
JQuery
```
To start the project:

First you should create a directory which will contain the folder you want to store the contents of the project, i.e.
```
mkdir repos
```
Then perform the
```
git clone
```
operation.
This should create a folder for you with all the contents of the project.
Open the folder and right click the
```
TVpackage.html
``` 
file, and select "Open with Chrome" to run the HTML application.

The following are the external CSS and JS files that were used.
```
TVPackage.css
TVpackage.js
```
I have utilized the above front end technology stack because
I chose to build this project as a single page web application and
I had the most experience in this stack. I implemented all the required features
correctly and got the application to work, and I also included CSS animations to show
the recommended packages. <br/>
Some things that I wanted to implement in the styling that I got to work correctly were:
```
I was able to disable 'World' if the user selected any other specified plan
I was able to disable all phone plans if the user did not want to use a phone service
```
Some things that could have been improved were:
```
Although the functionality and calculations work correctly, I felt there was a more efficient way to calculate the amount of data needed if the user had more than 2 devices.
The additional data could have been calculated as 'twoDeviceData + devices + simultaneousDevices - 4' when the user had more than two devices.
This would have removed all the if statements that making my code too long.
Although it was not required, I could have used AngularJS or Bootstrap (which I have limited experience with) to make the application mobile friendly.
```
